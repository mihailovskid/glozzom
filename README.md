I used Bootstrap for this website

A website that is linked to 5 different websites, you can change them by clicking on each of the links in the menu. On the home page, the nav menu contains a logo and links from the dense side, for mobile size, the links are collected in a drop down menu that can be opened with the hamburger icon that appears on the right side, on the active class there is a border on the left side. In the header there is a carousel with 3 images that have an automatic change at a certain time, each of the images has its own title with a different position, with the help of the indicators we can make additional changes to the images. Parallax has been used for the background images below,
a section is made with a modal that contains a video and below it there are several modals that contain images, clicking on each of the images opens its default image. Simple form is created below. On the second page, the Abou Us header has a background image with a parallax effect, an image that occupies a small space of the header, cards on the bottom part with responsiveness for tablet and mobile, on the bottom part there is again a carousel that can be changed by clicking the arrows that are placed on the left and right sides. In Services there are also regular cards and on the bottom part accordion that can open all questions without automatic closing, on the next page Blog we have regular cards with images from Lorem Picsum, on the last page Contact Us a form with form group is made and on the bottom part has 4 pictures.
